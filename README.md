Scraping News
=============================================
This app allows users to view and comment on news articles from [The Onion](https://www.theonion.com/) (America's Finest News Source). It utilizes the NPM packages Cheerio and Mongoose to scrape breaking (fake) news from The Onion and render it to the page from my Node server using Express routing. Data is stored in a MongoDB database, so all user comments are visible on each article and stored permanently until deleted!
